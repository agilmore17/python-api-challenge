API Challenge for UofR Data Bootcamp

All code within the assignment is my own & was not taken from any source outside of class notes. 

This challenge was definitely the easiest so far except for one mistake that I made which caused me to have to spend more hours on it.

It pretty much took no time to complete compared to some of the other ones, but I kept having issues with my API key for the VacationPy challenge.

After looking over the code for what felt like hours, I realized that it was a missing capitalization within my code for the parameters for the API key. I had it written as "apikey" but it needed to be "apiKey". 

Always surprising how a little mistake can go so ealsiy overlooked!
